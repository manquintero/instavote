# Example Voting (Instavote) App

=========

## Getting started

This is a Polyglot application (python/node/java) that will be used to demonstrate
some of the common Continous Integration and Continous Delivery practices by leveraging
[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](architecture.png)

* A Python webapp that lets you vote between two options
* A Redis queue that collects new votes
* A Java worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
* A Node.js webapp that shows the results of the voting in real time

### Note

The voting application only accepts one vote per client. It does not register votes
if a vote has already been submitted by a client.
