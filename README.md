# Example Voting (Instavote) App

=========

## Getting started

This is a Polyglot application (python/node/java) that will be used to demonstrate
some of the common Continous Integration and Continous Delivery practices by leveraging
[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](architecture.png)

* A Python webapp that lets you vote between two options
* A Redis queue that collects new votes
* A Java worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A Postgres database backed by a Docker volume
* A Node.js webapp that shows the results of the voting in real time

### Note

The voting application only accepts one vote per client. It does not register votes
if a vote has already been submitted by a client.

## Features

### Introduce Vote Application (python)

This introduces the workflow [python-app.yaml](.github/workflows/python-app.yaml)
that is triggered whenever a `pull_request` or `push` event is received. It performs
the next tasks

1. Checkout the source code
1. Setup Python 3.10
1. Install Package Dependencies and Auxiliary tools
1. Runs Linting and Style checks
1. Runs Automated Unit Tests
1. Checks for LeftOvers in the code

### Fix Linter Issues and Add Coverage Information

Fixing the first iteration of the code we added the next changes

1. Fix Linter findings for the `vote` application
1. Publish Test Results to the Action Run
1. Introduces `pytest-cov` to track Coverage information
1. Publish Coverage Data
